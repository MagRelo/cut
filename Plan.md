# Converting React Frontend to Native App - Implementation Plan

## 1. Development Environment & Setup

- Choose between React Native or Native development (iOS/Android) --> We choose React native
- Set up development environment
  - Xcode for iOS development
  - Android Studio for Android development
  - React Native CLI or Expo (if choosing React Native) - --> Now on this step...
- Configure build tools and dependencies
- Set up version control and branching strategy

## 2. Developer Accounts & Certificates

- Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
  - Create Apple Developer account
  - Generate certificates and provisioning profiles
  - Set up App Store Connect
- Google Play Developer Account ($25 one-time fee)
  - Create Google Play Console account
  - Generate signing keys
  - Set up Google Play Console

## 3. Code Migration Strategy

- Identify React components to be converted
- Plan native UI component mapping
- Design state management approach
- Handle navigation/routing conversion
- Implement native-specific features
- Plan API integration strategy

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

- Unit testing framework setup
- Integration testing strategy
- UI/UX testing
- Performance testing
- Device compatibility testing
- Beta testing program setup

## 5. Build & Deployment Pipeline

- CI/CD setup
  - GitHub Actions/Jenkins/CircleCI
- Automated build process
- Code signing automation
- Version management
- Environment configuration
- Build artifact management

## 6. App Store Submission

- App Store (iOS)
  - App metadata preparation
  - Screenshots and preview videos
  - App description and keywords
  - Privacy policy
  - App Store guidelines compliance
- Google Play Store (Android)
  - Store listing preparation
  - Content rating questionnaire
  - Privacy policy
  - Play Store guidelines compliance

## 7. Update & Maintenance Strategy

- Hot fixes procedure
- Feature flag system
- Analytics and monitoring
- Crash reporting setup

## 8. Security Considerations

- Secure storage implementation
- Network security
- API security
- Data encryption
- Authentication/Authorization
- App signing security

## 9. Performance Optimization

- App size optimization

## 10. Documentation

- Technical documentation
- API documentation
- Build and deployment guides
- Troubleshooting guides
- User documentation
- Maintenance procedures

## Next Steps

1. Evaluate and choose between React Native vs. Native development
2. Set up development environment
3. Create developer accounts
4. Begin component migration planning
5. Set up initial project structure
