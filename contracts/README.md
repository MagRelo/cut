## ‚ö° What This Infrastructure Enables

### üéØ Engage Spectators Financially

Transform passive viewers into active participants with skin in the game:

- **Prediction Markets:** Spectators predict on competitors using dynamic LMSR pricing
- **Real Stakes:** Put money behind predictions - winners take all collateral
- **Price Discovery:** Market-driven odds reveal true competitor rankings
- **Early Advantage:** First predictors get better prices (incentivizes early engagement)
- **Safe Withdrawals:** 100% refunds during OPEN phase (change your mind before competition starts)

### üí∞ Aligned Incentives

Smart fee structure benefits all participants:

- **Spectator Fees Augment Prizes:** 7.5% goes to competition prize pool (bigger prizes!)
- **Popularity Bonuses:** 7.5% distributed to competitors based on prediction volume
- **Configurable Oracle Fee:** Platform takes 1-10% for providing infrastructure
- **No Hidden Costs:** All fees transparent and enforced by smart contract
- **Deferred Fee Collection:** Fees only collected at settlement (enables free withdrawals in OPEN phase)

### üéÆ Flexible Architecture

Works with any competition format you can imagine:

- **Entry-Based:** One user can have multiple entries (strategies, lineups, teams)
- **Any Scoring System:** Your oracle reports results - contracts handle payouts
- **Configurable Economics:** Set deposit amounts, fees, LMSR curves per contest
- **Multiple Payouts:** Distribute prizes however you want (60/30/10, winner-take-all, top 10, etc.)
- **Yield Generation:** Idle USDC earns Compound V3 yield for platform treasury
- **Custom Branding:** Deploy tokens with your platform's name and symbol

### ‚ö° Instant, Trustless Settlement

No manual calculations, no disputes, no delays:

- **One Transaction Settles Everything:** Single oracle call distributes both competition prizes AND prediction market payouts
- **Two-Layer Economy:** Layer 1 (competition) + Layer 2 (predictions) unified in one smart contract
- **No Trusted Intermediary:** Smart contracts hold all funds - no platform custodian risk
- **Automated Bonuses:** Popular competitors automatically earn extra rewards from prediction volume
- **Force Distribution:** After expiry, unclaimed funds auto-pushed to winners (never locked forever)

### üîí Secure & Verifiable

All actions transparent and tamper-proof on-chain:

- **Immutable Rules:** Competition parameters locked at deployment
- **Verifiable Deposits:** All stakes visible on-chain
- **Audit Trail:** Every prediction, withdrawal, and claim recorded permanently
- **Reentrancy Protected:** OpenZeppelin security standards throughout
- **Arbitrage-Proof:** No token swaps allowed - prevents market manipulation
- **Refund Guarantees:** Automatic 100% refunds on entry withdrawals (spectators protected)

## üåç Competition Examples

This infrastructure is **competition-agnostic** - it works with any format that has measurable outcomes:

### Fantasy Sports

- **Golf:** Users draft golfers, compete based on tournament results
- **Football:** Weekly fantasy lineups compete for prizes
- **Basketball:** Season-long leagues with weekly scoring

### Gaming & Esports

- **Battle Royale:** Tournament brackets with elimination rounds

  - ‚úÖ Multiple independent entries
  - ‚úÖ Measurable outcomes
  - ‚úÖ Ranked results (or binary win/loss)
  - ‚úÖ Trusted oracle to report results

## üìÖ Contest Lifecycle

### Phase 1: OPEN - Registration & Early Predictions

**State:** `ContestState.OPEN`  
**Predictions:** ‚úÖ Available (early predictions enabled)

| Actor            | Can Do                                  | Function                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Competitors**  | Join contest with entry ID              | `joinContest(entryId)`                |
| **Competitors**  | Leave contest (auto-refunds spectators) | `leaveContest(entryId)`               |
| **Spectators**   | Check prices                            | `calculateEntryPrice(entryId)`        |
| **Spectators**   | Add prediction                          | `addPrediction(entryId, amount)`      |
| **Spectators**   | Withdraw (100% refund)                  | `withdrawPrediction(entryId, tokens)` |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Activate contest                        | `activateContest()`                   |

**State transition:** Oracle calls `activateContest()` ‚Üí `ACTIVE`

---

### Phase 2: ACTIVE - Competition Running, Predictions Open

**State:** `ContestState.ACTIVE`  
**Predictions:** ‚úÖ Available  
**Withdrawals:** ‚ùå NOT allowed (predictions locked in once competition starts)

| Actor            | Can Do                 | Function                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Competitors**  | ‚ùå Cannot join/leave   | -                                        |
| **Spectators**   | Add predictions (LMSR) | `addPrediction(entryId, amount)`         |
| **Spectators**   | ‚ùå Cannot withdraw     | -                                        |
| **Spectators**   | Check prices           | `calculateEntryPrice(entryId)`           |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Close predictions      | `closePredictions()`                     |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Cancel contest         | `cancelContest()`                        |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Settle (if not locked) | `settleContest(winningEntries, payouts)` |

**State transition:** Oracle calls `closePredictions()` ‚Üí `LOCKED`

**Note:** Once the contest is activated, spectators can still add new predictions but CANNOT withdraw existing predictions. This prevents unfair behavior as the competition progresses and outcomes become clearer.

---

### Phase 3: LOCKED - Competition Finishing, Predictions Closed

**State:** `ContestState.LOCKED`  
**Predictions:** ‚ùå Closed

| Actor            | Can Do                 | Function                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Competitors**  | ‚ùå Waiting for results | -                                            |
| **Spectators**   | Check prices (locked)  | `calculateEntryPrice(entryId)`               |
| **Spectators**   | ‚ùå Cannot predict      | -                                            |
| **Spectators**   | ‚ùå Cannot withdraw     | -                                            |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Settle contest         | `settleContest(winningEntries[], payouts[])` |

**Purpose:** Competition is finishing, outcome not yet certain, but predictions locked to prevent last-second unfair predictions.

**Note:** This phase is optional - oracle can call `settleContest()` directly from ACTIVE state.

**State transition:** Oracle calls `settleContest()` ‚Üí `SETTLED`

---

### Phase 4: SETTLED - Claiming

**State:** `ContestState.SETTLED`  
**Predictions:** Closed

| Actor            | Can Do                                | Function                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Competitors**  | Claim single entry payout             | `claimEntryPayout(entryId)`      |
| **Competitors**  | Claim all entries at once             | `claimAllEntryPayouts()`         |
| **Spectators**   | Check final prices                    | `calculateEntryPrice(entryId)`   |
| **Spectators**   | Claim prediction payout               | `claimPredictionPayout(entryId)` |
| **Spectators**   | Winners get payout, losers get 0      | Same function                    |
| **Oracle/Admin** | Distribute after expiry (see Phase 5) | `distributeExpiredContest()`     |

**State transition:** Oracle calls `distributeExpiredContest()` (after expiry) ‚Üí `CLOSED`

---

### Phase 5: CLOSED - Force Distribution (After Expiry)

**State:** `ContestState.CLOSED`  
**Trigger:** Oracle calls `distributeExpiredContest()` after contest expiry

| Actor            | Can Do                          | Function |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| **All Users**    | Already received forced payouts | -        |
| **Oracle/Admin** | ‚ùå No more actions              | -        |

**Purpose:** Prevent funds from being locked forever if users forget to claim.

**How it works:**

- After expiry timestamp, oracle can call `distributeExpiredContest()`
- Automatically pushes all unclaimed payouts to users
- Competitors receive their unclaimed prizes
- Winning spectators receive their unclaimed winnings
- Losing spectators get nothing (winner-take-all already determined)

**Terminal state:** Contest fully closed, all funds distributed.

---

### (Alternative) CANCELLED - Refunds

**State:** `ContestState.CANCELLED`

| Actor            | Can Do                                 | Function                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Competitors**  | Get full refund (100% of deposit)      | `leaveContest(entryId)`               |
| **Spectators**   | Check prices (locked)                  | `calculateEntryPrice(entryId)`        |
| **Spectators**   | Get full refund (100% including fees!) | `withdrawPrediction(entryId, tokens)` |
| **Oracle/Admin** | ‚ùå No more actions                     | -                                     |

**Terminal state:** Contest cancelled, all deposits refunded.

**How to get to CANCELLED:**

- Oracle calls `cancelContest()` (anytime before SETTLED - settlement is final!)
- Anyone calls `cancelExpired()` (after expiry timestamp, if not settled)

**Refund guarantee:**

```
Competitors: Get back full deposit amount
Spectators: Get back 100% of what they deposited (including entry fees!)

Example:
- Spectator deposited 100 tokens
- Entry fee was 15 tokens
- If cancelled: Get back full 100 tokens ‚úÖ
```

## üéÆ How It Works

### Full User Flow

```
1. User deposits stablecoin (USDC)
   ‚îú‚îÄ DepositManager.depositUSDC(100 USDC)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Receives: 100 platform tokens (1:1 ratio)

2A. User enters as competitor
   ‚îú‚îÄ System generates unique entryId: 12345
   ‚îú‚îÄ Contest.joinContest(12345) with deposit amount
   ‚îî‚îÄ Competes for prizes

   OR

2B. User predicts as spectator
   ‚îú‚îÄ Contest.addPrediction(entryId, 50 tokens)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Receives ERC1155 tokens at dynamic LMSR price

3. Competition completes & settles
   ‚îú‚îÄ Oracle calls Contest.settleContest(winningEntries, payouts)
   ‚îî‚îÄ ONE call settles both layers! (only winners needed)

4. Users claim winnings
   ‚îú‚îÄ Competitors: Contest.claimEntryPayout(entryId) or claimAllEntryPayouts()
   ‚îú‚îÄ Spectators: Contest.claimPredictionPayout(entryId)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Receive platform tokens

5. Convert back to stablecoin
   ‚îú‚îÄ DepositManager.withdrawUSDC(100 tokens)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Receives: 100 USDC (1:1 ratio)
```

## üí∞ Economic Model

### Example: 3 competitors, 10 spectators

**Phase 1: Competitors Enter**

```
Entry A deposits: 100 tokens
Entry B deposits: 100 tokens
Entry C deposits: 100 tokens
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Layer 1 pool: 300 tokens
```

**Phase 2: Spectators Predict**

```
5 people predict 100 tokens on Entry B = 500 tokens (50% of volume)
3 people predict 100 tokens on Entry A = 300 tokens (30% of volume)
2 people predict 100 tokens on Entry C = 200 tokens (20% of volume)
‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
Total spectator deposits: 1,000 tokens

Entry fees (15%): 150 tokens
‚îú‚îÄ Prize bonus: 75 tokens ‚Üí augments Layer 1 pool
‚îî‚îÄ Competitor bonuses: 75 tokens ‚Üí split by prediction volume
    ‚îú‚îÄ Entry B: 37.50 tokens (50% of prediction volume) ‚Üê Based on popularity!
    ‚îú‚îÄ Entry A: 22.50 tokens (30% of prediction volume)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Entry C: 15 tokens (20% of prediction volume)

Spectator collateral: 850 tokens (backs tokens)
```

**Phase 3: ONE Oracle Call Settles**

```solidity
contest.settleContest(
    [entryB, entryA, entryC],  // Winning entry IDs (only non-zero payouts)
    [6000, 3000, 1000]          // 60%, 30%, 10%
)
// Note: Only pass entries that receive payouts - no zeros needed!
```

**What happens:**

1. Calculate total pool:

   - Competitor deposits: 300 tokens
   - Prize bonus: 75 tokens
   - Competitor bonuses: 75 tokens
   - **Total: 450 tokens**

2. Apply oracle fee (1%) to ENTIRE pool:

   - Oracle fee: 4.50 tokens
   - **After fee: 445.50 tokens**

3. Distribute Layer 1 prizes (from 375 - 1% = 371.25 tokens):

   - Entry B: 222.75 tokens (60% ‚Üê Oracle sets based on PERFORMANCE)
   - Entry A: 111.38 tokens (30% ‚Üê Oracle sets)
   - Entry C: 37.13 tokens (10% ‚Üê Oracle sets)

4. Distribute Layer 2 bonuses (from 75 - 1% = 74.25 tokens):

   - Entry B: 37.13 tokens (50% ‚Üê Based on PREDICTION VOLUME)
   - Entry A: 22.28 tokens (30% ‚Üê Based on volume)
   - Entry C: 14.85 tokens (20% ‚Üê Based on volume)

   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Layer 1 (performance) and Layer 2 (popularity) are independent!
   An unpopular winner gets big Layer 1 prize (60%) but small Layer 2 bonus (20%).

5. Set Layer 2 winner: Entry B (100%), others (0%)

**Phase 4: Users Claim**

Layer 1 (Competitors):

```
Entry B owner claims: 222.75 + 37.13 = 259.88 tokens total (160% ROI!)
Entry A owner claims: 111.38 + 22.28 = 133.66 tokens (34% ROI)
Entry C owner claims: 37.13 + 14.85 = 51.98 tokens (-48% but got bonuses!)

Note: Oracle fee (1%) applied to both prizes AND bonuses
```

Layer 2 (Spectators):

```
Entry B predictors (winners):
‚îú‚îÄ Hold ~515 tokens total
‚îú‚îÄ Redeem for: 850 tokens (all collateral!)
‚îú‚îÄ Invested: 500 tokens
‚îî‚îÄ Profit: +350 tokens (+70% ROI for picking winner!)

Entry A predictors: 0 tokens (winner-take-all)
Entry C predictors: 0 tokens (winner-take-all)
```

## üîê Security Features

‚úÖ **No arbitrage** - Swaps disabled, LMSR only on entry  
‚úÖ **Reentrancy protection** - All external calls guarded  
‚úÖ **Oracle control** - Only oracle can settle contests  
‚úÖ **Deferred fees** - Users can withdraw with full refunds during OPEN phase  
‚úÖ **Winner-take-all** - All collateral goes to winners  
‚úÖ **State validation** - Proper state checks throughout

## üìà Economics

### Competitor Earnings

```
Base prize: From competitor deposits
Bonus prize: From spectator entry fees (7.5%)
Volume bonus: From spectator prediction volume (7.5%)

Oracle fee: Applied to ALL competitor earnings (prizes + bonuses)

Total earnings: (Competition winnings + popularity bonuses) √ó (1 - oracleFee%)
```

**Oracle Fee Application:**

```
Total pool going to competitors:
‚îú‚îÄ Competitor deposits: 300 tokens
‚îú‚îÄ Prize bonus (7.5% of spectator deposits): 75 tokens
‚îî‚îÄ Volume bonuses (7.5% of spectator deposits): 75 tokens
    Total: 450 tokens

Oracle takes fee from ENTIRE pool:
‚îú‚îÄ Oracle fee (1% of 450): 4.50 tokens
‚îî‚îÄ Competitors receive: 445.50 tokens

Distribution (TWO INDEPENDENT calculations):
‚îú‚îÄ Layer 1 prizes: 371.25 tokens split by oracle's payoutBps[] ‚Üê Performance!
‚îî‚îÄ Layer 2 bonuses: 74.25 tokens split by prediction volume ‚Üê Popularity!

These percentages can differ! Layer 1 = skill, Layer 2 = popularity.
```

**Example:** Entry B wins with high prediction volume

```
Competition prize: 222.75 tokens (60% of augmented pool, after 1% oracle fee)
Volume bonus: 37.13 tokens (from being popular, after 1% oracle fee)
Total: 259.88 tokens on 100 token deposit = 160% ROI!

Oracle fee applies to ALL competitor earnings (prizes + bonuses)
```

### Spectator Earnings

```
Prediction amount: 100 tokens
Entry fee: 15 tokens (non-refundable after settlement)
Collateral: 85 tokens (backing)
Tokens received: 85 / LMSR_price

If predicted winner:
  Payout = (your tokens / total winning tokens) √ó total collateral

If predicted loser:
  Payout = 0 (winner-take-all!)
```

**Example:** Picking the winner

```
Invested: 100 tokens
Entry fee: -15 tokens (distributed to prize pool & competitors)
Collateral: 85 tokens

If win (hold 515/850 of tokens):
  Receive: (your % of winning tokens) √ó 850 tokens
  Potential: +42% ROI if others also predicted winner
```
