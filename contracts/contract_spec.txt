Contracts 

Purpose: This system will provide accounting for a fantasy sports platform. There are three main areas:
1) the escrow system (EscrowFactory & Escrow), and 2) the platform token system (PlatformToken & DepositManager). 
The third important area 3) is the integrations with existing contracts in the ecosystem to generate yield (this 
integration needs to happen in the DepositManager).

1) The Escrow System (see contracts EscrowFactory.sol & Escrow.sol - this is largely working as needed already)

2) The Platform Token: the token should be a simple, standard ERC20-compliant token that 
accepts USDC and mints/burn CUT. When USDC is deposited it is deposited into Compound Finance's V3 Comet contract (see /Users/mattlovan/Projects/personal/cut/contracts/docs/COMPOUND_V3_COMET_INTEGRATION.md). 
When CUT is burned we will withdraw from compound if necessary). All conversions from CUT to USDC  should always be 1:1 - any accumulated yield or balance in the DepositManager should remain and not be distributed.
