# Conditional Token Prediction Market - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

All components successfully implemented and tested with **32 passing tests**.

## What Was Built

### 1. Modified Escrow Contract (Layer 1)

**File:** `contracts/src/Escrow.sol`

**Changes Made:**

- Added `mapping(address => uint256) public finalPayouts` to store payout results
- Modified `distribute()` to save payouts: `finalPayouts[address] = amount`
- Added `getFinalPayouts(address[])` view function for external contracts

**Purpose:** Allows Layer 2 to read contest results without parsing events.

### 2. PredictionMarket Contract (Layer 2)

**File:** `contracts/src/PredictionMarket.sol` (451 lines)

**Core Features:**

#### Complete Set Minting

```solidity
deposit(100 USDC) â†’ mints:
  - 100 "User A wins" tokens (outcome 0)
  - 100 "User B wins" tokens (outcome 1)
  - 100 "User C wins" tokens (outcome 2)
```

#### LMSR-Priced Swaps

```solidity
swapOutcomes(fromId, toId, amount)
  â†’ Burns 'from' tokens
  â†’ Calculates cost via LMSR curve
  â†’ Mints fewer 'to' tokens
  â†’ Cost stays as collateral
```

#### Merge Complete Sets

```solidity
mergePositions(amount)
  â†’ Burns equal amounts of ALL outcomes
  â†’ Refunds collateral (exit mechanism)
```

#### Resolution from Layer 1

```solidity
resolveFromEscrow()
  â†’ Reads Layer 1 contest results
  â†’ Converts to basis point payout vector
  â†’ Enables redemptions
```

#### Token Redemption

```solidity
redeemPosition(outcomeId)
  â†’ Burns outcome tokens
  â†’ Pays: (balance Ã— payoutNumerator) / 10000
  â†’ Safety cap at available collateral
```

## Key Mechanics Demonstrated

### 1. Complete Set Conservation

**Property:** Sum of all outcome tokens always equals deposited collateral

```
Deposit 100 USDC:
  â†’ Get 100 A + 100 B + 100 C = 300 tokens total
  â†’ Total value = 100 USDC (not 300!)

After swaps:
  â†’ Hold 0 A + 180 B + 0 C = 180 tokens
  â†’ Total value still â‰¤ 100 USDC (minus swap costs)
```

### 2. LMSR Pricing (Bounded, No External Liquidity)

**Formula:** `cost = (amount Ã— |netPosition[to]|) / (liquidityParameter + |netPosition[to]|)`

**Behavior:**

- First swap: cost = 0 (no prior demand)
- Subsequent swaps: cost increases
- Popular outcomes become expensive
- Bounded: cost always < amount

**Example:**

```
Swap 100 Aâ†’B with liquidityParam=1000:
  netPosition[B] = 0   â†’ cost = 0
  netPosition[B] = 100 â†’ cost = 9.09
  netPosition[B] = 500 â†’ cost = 33.33
  netPosition[B] = 1000 â†’ cost = 50
```

### 3. Layered Resolution

```
Layer 1: Contest Escrow
  â”œâ”€ Users compete in fantasy golf
  â”œâ”€ Oracle resolves: User B wins (60%)
  â””â”€ Stores finalPayouts mapping

Layer 2: Prediction Market
  â”œâ”€ Reads Layer 1 participants
  â”œâ”€ Spectators bet on users
  â”œâ”€ Resolves from Layer 1 results
  â””â”€ Distributes based on same outcome percentages
```

### 4. Safety Mechanisms

**Collateral Cap:**

```solidity
// Never pay more than available
uint256 available = paymentToken.balanceOf(address(this));
if (payout > available) {
    payout = available;
}
```

**State Machine:**

```
OPEN â†’ CLOSED â†’ RESOLVED
  â†“       â†“         â†“
deposit  close   redeem
swap     resolve
merge
```

## Gas Costs

From gas report:

| Function            | Min    | Avg     | Max     |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| deposit()           | 23,805 | 148,508 | 182,901 |
| swapOutcomes()      | 24,109 | 70,968  | 92,188  |
| mergePositions()    | 31,187 | 95,644  | 160,102 |
| resolveFromEscrow() | 23,544 | 116,596 | 175,387 |
| redeemPosition()    | 28,780 | 55,720  | 70,770  |

**Notes:**

- ERC-1155 operations are gas-intensive
- Multiple token mints/burns per operation
- Trade-off between functionality and efficiency

## Use Case Solved

**Problem:** User A doesn't compete in fantasy golf but wants to bet on User B winning.

**Solution Implemented:**

```
Step 1: User B competes (Layer 1 Escrow)
  â””â”€ Deposits 100 USDC in contest

Step 2: Spectator A bets on User B (Layer 2 Market)
  â”œâ”€ Deposits 50 USDC
  â”œâ”€ Receives complete set: 50 of each user's outcome tokens
  â”œâ”€ Swaps to concentrate on User B: 50 Aâ†’B, 50 Câ†’B
  â””â”€ Now holds ~145 "User B" tokens (reduced by LMSR costs)

Step 3: Contest resolves
  â””â”€ Oracle: User B wins 60%

Step 4: Spectator A redeems
  â””â”€ 145 tokens Ã— 0.6 = 87 USDC
  â””â”€ Profit: 37 USDC (74% return!)
```

## Known Limitations

### 1. Payout Safety Cap

- When swap costs consume collateral, redemptions are capped
- Not ideal for production - would need better normalization
- Works for exploration/understanding mechanics

### 2. First-Come-First-Serve Redemptions

- If collateral insufficient, early redeemers get paid first
- Later redeemers may get nothing
- Would need proportional distribution in production

### 3. No Cancellation After Trading

- If tokens traded, can't easily cancel market
- Unlike Escrow which can refund all participants
- Trade-off of tradeable positions

### 4. LMSR is Simplified

- Uses linear approximation, not full logarithmic curve
- Good enough for understanding mechanics
- Production would use more sophisticated formula

## Future Extensions (Not Implemented)

### 1. Revenue Sharing

```solidity
// Share swap costs with contestants being bet on
contestantBonuses[userB] += swapCost * 0.5;
```

### 2. Improved Payout Normalization

```solidity
// Scale all payouts proportionally to available collateral
// Prevents first-come-first-serve issues
```

### 3. Nested Conditions

```solidity
// Bet on "User B wins AND scores > 850"
// Requires combining multiple conditions
```

### 4. Dynamic Liquidity Parameter

```solidity
// Adjust curve based on participation
liquidityParameter = BASE + (totalCollateral / 10);
```

```

## What You Learned

### âœ… Complete Sets Preserve Value

Every token combination equals deposited collateral - no value created or destroyed.

### âœ… LMSR Provides Liquidity Without External LPs

Mathematical curve provides instant swaps without needing liquidity providers.

### âœ… Collateral-Bounded LMSR Prevents Unbounded Loss

Only minting from deposited collateral caps maximum payout, ensuring solvency.

### âœ… Layer 2 Derives from Layer 1

Prediction markets can be built on top of existing contests without modifying them.

### âœ… "Betting on Users" Use Case Works

Spectators can bet on contestants without competing directly.

## Running the Code

```bash
cd contracts

forge test --match-contract PredictionMarket -vv

# Run LMSR-specific tests
forge test --match-contract PredictionMarketLMSR -vv

## Next Steps (If Pursuing Further)

1. **Improve Payout Logic**

   - Implement proportional distribution when collateral insufficient
   - Pre-calculate total required payouts before any redemption

2. **Add Revenue Sharing**

   - Share swap costs with contestants being bet on
   - Incentivize skilled players to compete

3. **Frontend Integration**

   - Build UI to display implied probabilities
   - Show LMSR pricing curves
   - Enable token trading interface

4. **Multi-Layer Recursion**

   - Implement "betting on bettors" (Layer 3)
   - Explore meta-markets

5. **Production Hardening**
   - Full LMSR implementation
   - Oracle upgrades
   - Emergency pause mechanisms

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully demonstrates:

- How conditional tokens work in practice
- How LMSR pricing enables self-contained markets
- How to layer betting markets on top of contests
- The mechanics needed for "betting on users" feature

The code is functional and tested, suitable for understanding the mechanics. For production deployment, would need the improvements outlined above.
