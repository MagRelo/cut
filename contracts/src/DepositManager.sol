/**
 * @title DepositManager
 * @author Bet the Cut Team
 * @dev Manages USDC deposits, CUT token minting/burning, and yield generation through Compound V3
 * 
 * This contract implements a simplified token system where:
 * - Users deposit USDC and receive CUT tokens in a 1:1 ratio
 * - USDC is automatically supplied to Compound V3 for yield generation
 * - If Compound V3 is paused or deposit fails, USDC is stored directly in the contract
 * - Users can withdraw their original deposit amount (1:1 ratio)
 * - All yield generated stays in the contract for platform use
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - 1:1 USDC to CUT token conversion
 * - Automatic Compound V3 integration for yield generation
 * - Fallback to direct USDC storage if Compound is unavailable
 * - Yield retention by platform (no user distribution)
 * - Emergency withdrawal capabilities
 * - Compound V3 pause state handling with graceful fallback
 * 
 * @custom:security This contract uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard and Ownable for security
