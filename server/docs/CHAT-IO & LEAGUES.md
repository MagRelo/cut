# Chat Integration

We will use getstream.io as a chat integration

Node client docs: https://getstream.io/chat/docs/node/?language=javascript
React client docs: https://getstream.io/chat/docs/sdk/react/

## Relationship between our db's "League" and getstream's "Channel"

getstream has a concept of a "channel" and our app has a concept of a "League". These have a 1-to-1 relationship: every league should always have a channel, and every league member should be a member of that channel. When a user joins or leaves a league they should also be added or removed from the getstream channel. this implies that the getstream server functions should be integrated with the server's authentication and league functionality.

## Backend Integration Plan

### 1. Setup and Configuration

- Install GetStream.io server SDK: `npm install stream-chat`
- Create environment variables for GetStream credentials:
  - `GETSTREAM_API_KEY`
  - `GETSTREAM_API_SECRET`
  - `GETSTREAM_APP_ID`

### 2. User Management Integration

- Create GetStream user when a new user registers in our app
- User properties to sync:
  - id (matching our database user ID)
  - name
  - image (avatar URL)
- Generate user token for frontend authentication

### 3. League-Channel Management

#### Channel Creation

- Create GetStream channel when a new League is created
- Channel properties:
  - type: 'league'
  - id: `league-${leagueId}`
  - name: League name
  - custom_data: { leagueId, createdAt, etc. }

#### Member Management

- Add users to channel when they join a league
- Remove users from channel when they leave a league
- Update member roles (admin/moderator) based on league roles

### 4. API Endpoints

```typescript
// Required endpoints:
POST /api/chat/token - Generate user token
POST /api/leagues/:leagueId/chat - Create/get channel for league
PUT /api/leagues/:leagueId/chat/members - Update channel members
DELETE /api/leagues/:leagueId/chat - Delete league channel
```

### 5. Error Handling

- Implement retry mechanisms for GetStream operations
- Handle synchronization errors between our DB and GetStream
- Log chat-related errors for monitoring

## Frontend Integration Plan

### 1. Setup and Configuration

- Install GetStream React SDK: `npm install stream-chat-react`
- Install required CSS: `npm install stream-chat-react/dist/css/index.css`
- Configure StreamChat instance with API key

### 2. Authentication Flow

- Initialize StreamChat with user token from backend
- Handle reconnection on token expiry
- Manage chat connection state

### 3. Chat Components Integration

#### League Chat Implementation

// Component hierarchy:

- LeagueChatProvider

  - ChatContainer
    - Channel
      - MessageList
      - MessageInput

- This component will replace the placeholder in the 'LeagueLobby.tsx' component

### 4. UI/UX Considerations

- Implement chat notifications
- Show typing indicators
- Display online/offline status
- Support file attachments and emojis
- Mobile-responsive design

### 5. Performance Optimization

- Implement message pagination
- Optimize image loading
- Handle offline capabilities
- Manage connection state

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests

- Unit tests for chat service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Channel creation/deletion flows
- Member management operations

### Frontend Tests

- Component rendering tests
- Chat connection handling
- Message sending/receiving
- Error state handling

## Deployment Considerations

### 1. Environment Setup

- Configure production credentials
- Set up monitoring for chat services
- Implement logging for chat operations

### 2. Scaling Considerations

- Monitor channel limits
- Implement rate limiting
- Handle concurrent connections

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication

- Secure token generation
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Validate user permissions

### 2. Data Privacy

- Ensure private messages are properly scoped
- Implement message retention policies
- Handle user data deletion requirements

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Metrics to Track

- Channel creation rate
- Message volume
- Error rates
- User engagement metrics

### 2. Maintenance Tasks

- Regular token rotation
- Channel cleanup for deleted leagues
- User data synchronization
